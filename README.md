README!

Well this project, I started to be spammed less on my GroupMe for Laundry Updates!
I started with develpoing a simple HTML form and adding a bit of CSS to it. Then, I made the Node.JS backend and kept working to get
emailing functionality setup.
Then worked with WebScraping to get data for status instead of user inputs.
